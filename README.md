# Deep-Learning-Lab

## Description

Code for the labs of the [Deep Learning course](https://uvadlc.github.io/) offered in MSc. in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.

### Lab 1 - MLPs, CNNs and Backpropagation
<p align="justify">
We explore image classification with two neural network architectures: multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). To gain an in-depth understanding we first focus on a basic implementation of a MLP in numpy and Pytorch. Apart from that we also learn to implemt custom operations in PyTorch by  reimplementing a batch-normalization layer.
