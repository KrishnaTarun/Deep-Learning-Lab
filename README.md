# Deep-Learning-Lab

## Description

Code for the labs of the [Deep Learning course](https://uvadlc.github.io/) offered in MSc. in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.

### Lab 1 - MLPs, CNNs and Backpropagation
<p align="justify">
We explore image classification with two neural network architectures: multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). To gain an in-depth understanding we first focus on a basic implementation of a MLP in numpy and Pytorch. Apart from that we also learn to implemt custom operations in PyTorch by reimplementing a batch-normalization layer.

#### Problems and Solutions
- [Main Problem statement](assignment_1/assignment_1.pdf), [Python code](assignment_1/code) and [report](assignment_1/Report_1.pdf)

### Lab 2 - Recurrent Neural Networks

<p align="justify">
We explore the long-term dependency modelling capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Networks (LSTMs). In the first part of the assignment we experiment on a simple palindrome task. By comparing the perfomnace of Vanilla RNN with LSTMs as the LSTM is more capable of learning long-term dependencies than the vanilla RNN. In the second part of the assignment (Part3) we use LSTMs as Genrative model to predict the next character in the the sentence.

#### Problems and Solutions
- [Main Problem statement](assignment_2/assignment_2.pdf), [Python code part1](assignment_2/part1), [Python code part3](assignment_2/part3) and [report](assignment_2/Report_2.pdf)

### Lab 3 - Deep Generative Models
<p align="justify">
We explore deep generative modelling with two—currently most popular—deep generative models, namely Variational Auto Encoders [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) and [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets).
